# Diesel-Locomotive
UPDATED TO 0.16, now use a new fuel tank mechanism, makes it a lot more stable and easier to uninstall. No longer use the fancy pump-wagon connection animation though. Also uses old Factorio locomotive graphic that has been refitted for the current version.

ADDS a diesel locomotive that uses liquid oil as fuel. By default, the locomotive can use crude oil, heavy oil, and light oil although can be configured to use any fluid in config.lua. ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR SAVE FIRST BEFORE INSTALLING. To fill up locomotive, use a pump like how you fill up a fluid wagon.

CAUTION
1. Diesel Locomotive has 3 separate fuel tanks and pumps its fuel to the front tank whenever possible, mimicking vanilla locomotive behavior to push fuels to its first item slot. Done as a   workaround due to vanilla vehicles mechanics.
2. Diesel Locomotive only accept liquid oil as fuel, will stall if any other fluids reach the front tank.
3. Diesel Locomotive might affect your electric network very very slightly due to using electric consuming hidden entity.
4. You can take out the fake fluids inside Diesel Locomotive burner inventory on god mode, this is some unsolvable issue. It will have some weird effect but nothing game crashing. Just don't mess with those fake items.
5. Graphics is not super crisp like some other mods since I only resize the old locomotive graphic. It is still, in my opinion, a lot better than if you just plug the old graphic into the new Factorio versions unedited.
6. It requires you to research diesel locomotive technology first which have oil processing and railway as prerequisites.
7. This mod hasn't been fully tested for bugs and instabilities, but I'm pretty sure nothing game-crashing or save-corrupting using this new mechanism.
